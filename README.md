# Articles

Welcome to the repository housing a collection of files and notebooks corresponding to articles I've authored on various platforms. As someone deeply immersed in the oil industry for over 22 years, my exploration into reservoir geophysics, geological modeling, and the design of innovative G&G workflows has been a journey of continuous learning and discovery.

In addition to my industry experience, I've mastered the realms of Big Data, Data Science, and Machine Learning. This repository serves as a consolidated hub for the code, analyses, and insights shared in my articles across different platforms.

Feel free to explore the diverse range of files and notebooks, each offering a deeper dive into specific topics related to energy, geophysics, and the ever-evolving landscape of data science. Your contributions, feedback, and engagement are highly valued.

Thank you for joining me on this knowledge-sharing endeavor. Let's collaborate, learn, and create impactful solutions in the realms of technology and the oil and gas industry.
